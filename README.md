SSIP Coachella Valley velocity model

SSIP Coachella Valley model provides P-wave velocities for the shallow 
crust in the northern Salton Trough. The model combines travel-time 
observations from explosions recorded during the Salton Seismic Imaging 
Project (SSIP) with local earthquake recordings. The model extends from
the surface to 9-km depth.

## Installation

This package is intended to be installed as part of the UCVM framework,
version 25.x or higher. 

## Library

The library ./lib/libcvlsu.a may be statically linked into any
user application. Also, if your system supports dynamic linking,
you will also have a ./lib/libcvlsu.so file that can be used
for dynamic linking. The header file defining the API is located
in ./include/cvlsu.h.

## Contact the authors

If you would like to contact the authors regarding this software,
please e-mail software@scec.org. Note this e-mail address should
be used for questions regarding the software itself (e.g. how
do I link the library properly?). Questions regarding the model's
science (e.g. on what paper is the COACHELLA valley velocity model
based?) should be directed to the model's authors, located in the
AUTHORS file.
